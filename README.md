# 📰 Magazine Object-Relations Code Challenge

This project implements a lightweight **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)-like system** in Python — built **without using any external ORM library** such as SQLAlchemy.  
It models relationships between **Authors**, **Magazines**, and **Articles** using **pure SQL** and **object-oriented programming principles**.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Three Core Models**
- `Author`, `Magazine`, and `Article` — each with strict data validation.  
- Implements one-to-many and many-to-many relationships using SQL joins.

✅ **SQLite Database**
- Lightweight local database.  
- Tables are automatically created when the app runs.

✅ **Relationships**
- Easily fetch related data, e.g.:
  - `author.articles()` → all articles by an author  
  - `magazine.contributors()` → all authors who wrote for a magazine  
  - `author.magazines()` → all magazines an author has written for  

✅ **Testing**
- Fully tested with `pytest` for reliability and correctness.  

✅ **No ORM**
- Pure SQL queries for educational transparency and hands-on learning.
